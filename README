Telephone.

An implementation of three functions:

numbers_to_words(s: str) -> str:

    Takes as an argument a string representing a US phone number and which outputs a
    string which has transformed part or all of the phone number into a single 
    "wordified" phone number that can be typed on a US telephone (for example, a
    valid output of number_to_words("1-800-724-6837") could be "1-800-PAINTER").

    NOTE: Should this be idempotent? Should it take in a vocabulary as well? If it isn't
    idempotent, should it be consistent given the same random seed (if it's selecting
    sections of the number and words to replace them at random).

words_to_number(s: str) -> str:

    Translates a wordified phone number back into a standard US numerical phone number.

all_wordifications(s: str, vocabulary: Set[str]) -> Set[str]:

    Computes all wordifications of the valid US phone number ``s`` given the plaintext
    uncased alpha vocab given by ``vocabulary``.
